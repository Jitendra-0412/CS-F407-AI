# CS-F407-AI
In this repository I maintain AI class notes, diagrams, and explanations of Artificial Intelligence fundamentals.

## Real-World Complexity in AI

The real world is not simple or predictable. It is dynamic, uncertain, and often incomplete. Artificial Intelligence focuses on building systems that can operate effectively in such complex environments.
Key factors involved in handling real-world complexity include:
- Intelligence: ability to perceive, learn, and act
- Reasoning: logical decision-making
- Rationale:justification for actions
- Ethics: responsible use of AI

## Sensors Used in the Intelligent Vehicle

- Front Camera (RGB-D): Captures color images along with depth information for object detection, lane detection, and distance estimation.
- Camera ToF: Measures depth by calculating the time taken by light to return, enabling accurate near-range distance sensing.
- LiDAR 3D: Uses laser pulses to generate a 3D map of the surroundings for precise environment perception and navigation.
- LiDAR 2D: Scans the environment in a single plane to detect obstacles and support collision avoidance.
- IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit): Measures acceleration, orientation, and angular velocity to track vehicle motion.
- GPS: Provides global position information for navigation and localization.
- Driver Biometric Sensor: Monitors the driver’s physical state such as heart rate or fatigue to enhance safety.
- Mechanical and Control Sensors: Include wheel encoders and steering sensors used to measure speed, motion, and vehicle control inputs.

## Theme of Artificial Intelligence

The central theme of Artificial Intelligence is the concept of the Intelligent Agent. AI is mainly concerned with studying how intelligent agents behave, learn, and make decisions.
- Artificial Intelligence can be defined as the study of Intelligent Agents.

## Purpose of Artificial Intelligence
The purpose of AI is to design intelligent agents that can perceive their environment, reason, and take appropriate actions in complex and dynamic situations.
- AI: Study and design of Intelligent Agents.
- IA: Core entity that perceives, decides, and acts.

### Alan Turing’s landmark paper published in 1950 called Computing Machines and Intelligence (CMI).

## Can Machines Think?
AI is evolving rapidly and giving rise to multiple subfields, each enabling machines to perform specific intelligent tasks:
- Machine Learning (ML): Allows machines to adapt to new situations and recognize patterns.
- Automated Causal Reasoning: Enables machines to draw meaningful conclusions from data.
- Knowledge Base Representation: Stores what the AI knows or has learned.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Lets machines communicate in a way humans can understand.

To create a Total Turing Machine - a machine capable of understanding and interacting with the world more like humans and additional capabilities are required:
- Computer Vision & Language Understanding: Provides perception of the entire world model.
- Robotics: Allows the machine to manipulate objects and interact physically with the world.
